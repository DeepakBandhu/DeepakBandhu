Going into my freshman year at Sacramento State University, I was adamant on my future career being in mechanical engineering. After that first year I quickly realized my passion was elsewhere. As time passed I realized my interest was where I spent the majority of my days, my computer. After a discussion with a friend who is in the field I was interested in, I was able to confirm that my true passion is being a Software Developer.
